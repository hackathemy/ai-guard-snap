# Introduction

## ðŸ’‚ AI GUARD

AI GUARD is a platform for using safe smart contracts.
It allows you to view contracts through existing hacking information, audit information, and information from AI platforms.

## ETHSeoul2024

In this ETHSeoul2024 Hackathon, we will create and provide a function through this API to provide information to Metamask Snap (Metamask Add-on) users before signing.

Supports ETH Sepolia, Injective inEVM, Astar zkEVM, NEON, Fhenix, and Celo chains.

It can be used in various wallets and services using the API, and we are creating a library so that it can be easily used in WalletConnect, Wagmi, Foundry, etc. (lack of time)
